# Homework

Now that you know ActiveRecord Associations `has_many` and `belongs_to`, go back into your blog app, create two new Models:

* Category: a post `belongs_to` a category. A category `has_many` posts. A category has a name.
* Suggest Reading: a suggested reading `belongs_to` a post. A post `has_many` suggested readings. A suggested reading is a link with an address and a title.

# Instructions

* Complete the following user stories.
* By the end of this exercise:
  * You should have a working category feature and a working suggested readings feature.
  * You should have category views that all posts within a particular category.
  * You should have a view for individual blog posts that displays the post's title, post's body, suggested readings, and comments. You should have a link to add a new reading beneath the listed readings, and a link to create a new comment under the listed comments.

# Notes

* Your blog entries may be called "articles" instead of "posts".
* Your "suggested readings" may be called "links" instead.
* You will not need to create any forms on the `post/show` page. You should be able to click a link from the post in order to create a new comment or link.
